Micro SD card 32gb shows error message, inspite of the fact that it's blank, it asks to format.\nThere is no alert as such, but it gets notification when motion is detected. One way calling facilities active even from a distance of 2000kms..value for money..for outdoor safety it's recommended.."", ""Recently, I decided to try the MI Xiaomi Wireless Home Security Camera 2i 2022 Edition, and I have been impressed with its performance, features, and affordability. Here is a detailed review of this security camera.\n\nImage Quality and Performance:\nThe MI Xiaomi Wireless Home Security Camera 2i 2022 Edition boasts a 1080p full HD resolution, providing crisp and clear images during the day. The infrared night vision feature ensures excellent visibility in low-light conditions, allowing for continuous monitoring throughout the day and night. The 130-degree wide-angle lens offers extensive coverage, reducing blind spots and capturing a broader view of the monitored area.\n\nEase of Installation and Use:\nOne of the standout features of this security camera is its ease of installation and use. The camera connects wirelessly to your home Wi-Fi network, eliminating the need for complicated wiring or professional installation. The user-friendly MI Home app allows for seamless setup, live streaming, and remote access from your smartphone or tablet, making it easy to monitor your home while on the go.\n\nMotion Detection and Alerts:\nThe MI Xiaomi Wireless Home Security Camera 2i 2022 Edition is equipped with intelligent motion detection, which sends instant notifications to your smartphone or tablet when any unusual activity is detected. This feature ensures that you are always aware of what is happening in your home, providing peace of mind and added security.\n\nTwo-Way Audio:\nThis security camera features a built-in microphone and speaker, allowing for two-way audio communication. This function is particularly useful for communicating with family members, pets, or even potential intruders in real-time.\n\nData Storage and Security:\nThe MI Xiaomi Wireless Home Security Camera 2i 2022 Edition offers multiple storage options, including local storage via a microSD card and cloud storage through the MI Cloud service. The camera's secure encryption ensures that your data remains protected and private.\n\nAffordability:\nOne of the main selling points of the MI Xiaomi Wireless Home Security Camera 2i 2022 Edition is its affordability. Despite its impressive features and performance, this security camera is competitively priced, making it an excellent option for homeowners on a budget.\n\nMinor Drawback:\nThe only minor drawback of this security camera is that it requires a stable Wi-Fi connection to function optimally. In areas with weak or inconsistent Wi-Fi signals, the camera's performance may be affected.\n\nIn conclusion, the MI Xiaomi Wireless Home Security Camera 2i 2022 Edition offers excellent value for money, providing high-quality images, advanced features, and ease of use at an affordable price. With a 5-star rating, I highly recommend this security camera to anyone looking for a reliable and budget-friendly home security solution."", ""I like the quality of the video recording. It records 1080p video which looks clear even in low light conditions.\nIt also have the event detection feature which records videos when some movement is detected and the best part is that the video clips are stored in cloud for later viewing. I will buy a couple of more cameras to cover my whole house.\nOnly one thing which I didn't like was that the camera which I received was a used unit as the seal on the packaging was broken (see picture) and camera has to be reset to be used for the first time.\nDon't buy from this seller but buy this camera even if it is a bit expensive. The cloud storage makes up for the price. Product highly recommended but the seller not so much."", 'Have to wait for a loooong time to connect. In case of emergency monitoring situation, this camera will not provide live feed instantly because of its connectivity issue.\n\nVideo streaming is also slow especially while changing the position of the camera.\nAnd it doesn’t have object tracking/motion tracking\n\nAlready I’m using realme cam for the past two years. Comparing to realme smartcam 360, redmi 2i was very slow. Connecting time is also very slow.\n\nAudio and video quality is not as realme smart cam\n\nBetter go for realme. You can have 16 days backups, good build quality, But the only thing, the lens got damaged in realme. I still don’t got any firmware updates. And the video stored in encrypted format. This might be a positive side and as well as negative side of the camera. you can access the backups only through the app.\nBut mi doesn’t have.\nEven though I have these many issues, realme camera is a step ahead of mi security camera\n\nBoth are almost same price right!\nIt is up to you.\n\nMi 2i camera is not good as they advertise.', ""New Generation Camera's Built quality is really bad and cheap. It was much better before and now it's not good at all. Finally they showed their Chinese pledge. I still appreciate their app and the camera quality! If you can manage it properly then you should buy it. But now, it won't last long. And its too expensive with that built quality. Better look other options too. I have 4 old Cameras and two new. Both new is dead within a time gap of 3 months. And old one is alive since 4 years. Even outdoor (not under direct sky), Night vision is awesome."", '', 'Good', 'Excellent product from MI. But Wi-Fi properly not connecting even there is enough range.']",https://www.amazon.in/MI-Wireless-Security-Detection-Enhanced/dp/B0B51WPT24/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=camera&qid=1687375608&sr=8-1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hkb1CYemL._SX679_.jpg
1,TP-Link Tapo 360° 2MP 1080p Full HD Pan/Tilt Home Security Wi-Fi Smart Camera| Alexa Enabled| 2-Way Audio| Night Vision| Motion Detection| Sound and Light Alarm| Indoor CCTV (Tapo C200) White,"2,499",4.2,"["" Very useful and efficient surveillance camera. People complaining here either don't know how to play with the camera settings through the APP or customise various options in the APP as per the need. You have everything there on the TAPO App.\n\nYou have options like motion detection, person detection, baby crying detection, detection activity notifications on your mobile as per the customised schedule you want (without any subscription to cloud or anything), camera local alarm (warning) with flash and siren based on the set timings, recording with Audio, 2 way audio communication between camera and APP, motion tracking, privacy mode and what not?\n\nChoose 360 degree camera with pan and tilt option because you can get more than fixed cameras. It automatically rotate 360 degree based on the motion and continue to track until the activity is stopped. So, one camera does the work of 3 or 4 cameras and eliminates the requirement of more cameras. Using Pan and Tilt option on the App, rotate the camera to the required position, then mark, label and save it it so that wherever it rotates, it automatically comes back to the marked position. You can also manually bring the camera to marked position whenever it is away from your preferred direction.\n\nWhen the camera detects any person, it sends the notification to your phone with a snapshot of that detection person (when you have paid subscription). Free users also get notifications but without the snapshot picture. When you click on the notification, it automatically play back the recorded motion. It also warn the person with barking or siren kind of sound and a thin LED flashing. If it is home, it is better to set the timing only for nights to avoid too many notifications during the day time. Also, it's better to turn off the 'Motion detection' but keep the 'Person detection' ON, so that you can avoid unwanted notifications like tree, leaf movements etc.\n\nMake sure to connect the camera to inverter power line to work during power cuts also.\n\nAlthough upto 256 GB class 10 micro SD card can be used, we just need to buy 64 or 128 GB capacity memory card and set the camera option to 'detection recording only' rather than continuous recording so that you can make use of the card for longer days and easy to search & play back because motion recordings are usually smaller clips. You can play back, take a screenshot or download the recordings and share via WhatsApp or other Apps.\n\nOther good thing is, it continue to record even when there is internet outage and camera is not able to connect to the Wifi because of outage. That means, you can't watch live on your phone because the camera is not connected to wifi, but you can play back the detections recorded during outage once the internet is back and camera is connected back with WiFi signal. This is because the recorded clips are saved in the local memory card regardless of internet is there or not. But to play back on your phone, for sure, camera needs to be connected to internet through WiFi. In this sense, local storage is much preferable than paid cloud storage.\n\nYou can also share the device with the family members so that they can also watch live or play back from memory from anywhere in the world (not possible for the guest to change the settings in the APP, only admin can modify the settings). You can also add multiple cameras to the same APP and control all of them through settings from anywhere around the world.\n\nIf you have fibre broadband with 5G speed, connect the camera to 2.4G, because all the 5G broadband modems have dual band, i.e., it will have 2.4G option also. So, no issues.\n\nFor the people who are confusing about the paid subscription and all, let me tell you clearly, you don't need it at all! What you get additional for paying monthly or yearly subscription are 'Cloud storage' (which is not must if you have local memory card), 'AI detection', 'Snapshot notification' (free people still get notifications without snapshot) and something called 'Smart sort'. Nothing is going to affect you without the above features. For your reference, I've attached the screenshot about the paid plans and comparison between the two paid plans (basic and premium).\n\nOverall, I'm highly satisfied with the purchase and definitely will add more.\n\nMy only disappointment is the color of the power cord and adapter which is black, would have been nice if they have provided white color, so that it will match with the camera color, wall and ceiling which are mostly white. Other thing is, you can't watch this camera on your Android Smart TV, because when I tried to install the Tapo App on my TV through Google play store, it said, the App is not downloadable on TV units. This is something, Tapo needs to resolve.\n\nLet me know if this review is helpful to you!"", 'Works perfectly with geofencing and motion detection. It can be monitored from anywhere in the world.

2,"CP PLUS 2MP Full HD Smart Wi-Fi CCTV Home Security Camera |360° with Pan Tilt | View & Talk | Motion Alert | Night Vision | SD Card (Upto 128 GB), Alexa & Google Support | IR Distance 10mtr | CP-E25A","1,666",3.6,"[""Full Reveiw for this particular model:\nPros:\nCheaper\nEasy to connect and install\nMobile app available\nBuild quality is ok\nPicture is good\nMotion detect photo alert is sent to mobile app and notification sound is played (not long alarm, just message sound).\nCamera view can be controlled using app.\nCan be installed upside down on ceilings.\nIt is indoor cctv & Not fully outdoor cctv but does the job.\nHas 2 way speaking option (audio is of medium volume and quality is ok to good).\n\nImportant CONS:\nPoor overall sound while monitoring through app. Constant shrieking sound is made when audio is turned on and if there is any audio (so it should always be off when you open mobile app to hear any sound).\nAudio echo occurs.\nSD card is a MUST to record video (live stream is shown in app but for video record you need SD card on cctv. Record on mobile is available, i.e you need to open cctv in app, and then press record button just like how you do in your mobile camera, but that will close if you close the app.)\nMotion detect alert will show only an image in your phone, then you need to quickly see it in phone app. Else you cant view the video of what happened.\nNo option to view what's recorded in cctv sd card (also if you set loop recording, contents will be erased after sometime, so set to event based recording which will record only when there is any motion).\nImagine if cctv is stolen along with SD card, there is no way you can see what happened, you will be just left with one picture in app (so this is fully indoor, and you should not expect any movement, if any movement occurs, you need to quickly take action/call police, that's the only option you are left with).\nNeeds constant power supply, no battery backup and power cable is not very long, can jus place within 1-1.5 ft.\n\nCP PLUS must definitely provide access to view what is on SD card remotely, atleast store it in CLOUD for atleast 1-2 days, because, there is no way, people can constantly look out for motion alerts and keep watching it on mobile and say if cctv is stolen, nothing can be viewed. IT IS MUST THAT VIDEO ON SD CARD SHOULD BE SAVED ON CLOUD/ MOBILE AUTOMATICALLY. THATS THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE this CP PLUS CCTV.\n\nYou can buy if you just need to keep an eye for any motion. For permanent long time businesses or long time house tracking, this doesn't suit all the cases."", ""Concert to security in present scenario can't believe on anyone blindly , it is very good product to assure your Loveonce are safe at home at office etc. VERY EASY TO INTALL AND CLOUD STREAM IS IN YOUR HAND.

(Does not need internet in the WIFI though)\nCan be stuck on the celing with double sided tape or screws are provided.\nDoes not consume much power.\nNeeds a AC power plug.\nYou can remotely view live or recorded video on your cellphone using app. It needs your email to login.\nIt has night vision.\nIt also has motion detection and traking (its very bad tough)\nIf motion detected it will track it but wont go back to its original position automatically.', 'I had brought the camera to see my cat when he was alone and I was out.

You switch to Live View by pressing a button on the back of the camera and you can then use the touch control to set the focus point and change camera settings. It's sharp, colourful and clear and the touch response is awesome. Apart from the mechanical noise when the mirror is flipped up to enter Live View mode, this is just like using a mirrorless camera, as the autofocus response is just as rapid.\n\nOne thing I Don't understand why Canon Stores images only 72DPI while Nikon stores at 300DPI? Can any one explain this?\n\n4K video is a big selling point on this camera, but you do notice a couple of limitations , there's a significant 'crop factor' in 4K mode, which means your lens's angle of view effectively becomes narrower. Any how, I am not much using videos.\n\nBattery life is good and last for longer period.\n\nPros:\nVery light and compact DSLR\nDual pixel AF\nGreat Live View auto focus response\nVari-angle touchscreen\nSimple but effective controls\nBuiltin WiFi & Bluetooth.\n\nCons:\nOnly 9 AF points in viewfinder shooting.\nNot compatible for 3rd party flash must go with Canon only.\nNo USB charging.

Moreover,if you want to the cctv switch on /off you will have to do it by switching on/off the power supply(unlike other products there is no provision to do it with the app)."", 'Good', 'The camera has lot of issues which outweighs its features.\n\n1. It connected to the WiFi router, but the WiFi disconnects every 10-15 seconds and reconnects again. The issue is not there when connected to a different WiFi router. Couldn\'t find the reason why this happens. I have 98% signal in the camera. Customer care wasn\'t any help. I can see that a lot of people have the same issue.\n\n2. The camera announces ""disconnected from WiFi"" and ""connecting to WiFi"" everytime it connects. This is weird, because we don\'t want others to know that the security camera is disconnected. An app notification is all that is required.\n\n3. This camera has motion tracking, but it seems not working correctly. The camera doesn\'t always go back to its original position after the movement stops. Hence I\'ve disabled this feature in the app.\n\n4. Also, the camera is changing its position slightly for 2 days at night. So the footages are useless until it is manually moved back to the initial position. This is totally unacceptable behavior.\n\n5. Night vision is too bad. It is grainy. Looks like it doesn\'t have DNR / digital noise reduction. Video is also dull at night. It is usable only if used in a small room, or there is some light. If used outdoors (Use under the shade. Its not weather proof), turn on some light throughout the night. Otherwise night vision will be too dark and dull.\n\n6. Moving the camera position from the app instantly moves the camera lens. But the video has a lot of lag and it is difficult to control it from the app.\n\n7. Connecting to the video stream is laggy and it connects to the camera half of the time. Other time, we have to try again from the app.\n\nSo far all Cons. Now the pros are:\n1. It has good day time vision. It is excellent for the price for daytime use. No issues during the day.\n\n2. The motion detection notifications are good. We can see snapshots of the motion detection alerts. This is beneficial since we can see who or what moved in the camera field of view without playing each motion detection video. A quick glance can give a lot of information. I own Tapo cameras which gives this feature only with their paid subscription.\n\n3. This camera has LAN port, unlike other turret cameras in this price range.\n\n4. The camera has ONVIF support, so it can connect to NVR. (I haven\'t tested this feature yet).\n\nI own and also have shared multiple Tapo security cameras and they all were pretty good. Bought this CP Plus camera for someone else because of the price, features and the brand value, but the software issues made the user experience too bad. The issues make this camera unreliable and unusable for me.', 'The product is good with ONVIF protocol support.

The power Adapter is also made in India but by a Chinese company. Two-way communication works well, the mic of the camera picks up surrounding voices and noises well. The ""Siren"" is not loud enough to serve its purpose.\nAmazon details and packaging box says it works with Google Home (OK Google) as well, but there is no document or YouTube video explaining this. There was no instruction manual inside the box, not even the warranty card as mentioned on the box.\nA couple of desirable options, which could have made the product wonderful are:\nA lighter and more responsive Android App - the App is rather heavy and takes time to load and go live\nAn option to view the video on a smart TV (with Chromecast/Firestick) and/or Web Browser (thru login).
